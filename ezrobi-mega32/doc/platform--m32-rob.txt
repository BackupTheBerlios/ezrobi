   A hardware platform for the ezRobi project

   $Revision: 1.2 $

                                  An Overview

   The `M32-Rob' platform is a design of
   [[Wiedekind-Klein|[[1]http://www.roboterwelt.de/|Alexander]]]. It is
   based on a cheap Atmel AVR Mega32. This platform is designed with the
   following topics in mind:

   * low price: the Mega32 and the motor driver are very cheap!

   * availability: all the parts should be easy to get. In Germany you
   can order all the components at [[[[[2]http://www.reichelt.de/]]]]

   * no need for a PCB: the whole designed could be wired on a prototype
   board.

   * flexibility: all pins are accessible. Even if ezRobi don't care
   about them ;-)

                              Available Features

   The following list gives you an overview of the available features.

   * The `M32-Rob' can be programmed with the STK500 JTAG interface or
   with a cheap serial ISP programmer like the one used by famous
   Pony-Prog.

   * The motor driver BA6845FS is capable to drive two motors with 1A
   (each). See the datasheet fro details.

   * There are three LEDs and three keys for simply user-IO.

   * The UART is available as TTL. To connect to an PC, you have to use a
   level shifter (RS-232). One possible solution is the usage of adapter
   cables of older handys.

   * There are eight ADC inputs available (Port-A). The design uses Vcc
   as Vref.

   * Two external interrupt sources can be connected to connector ST9 and
   ST17.

   * The I2C bus is available on connector ST4.
