OVERVIEW
--------

The `M32-Rob' platform is a design of Alexander Wiedekind-Klein (see
http://www.roboterwelt.de/). It is based on a cheap Atmel AVR Mega32. It is
designed with the following topics in mind:

 * low price: The Mega32 and the motor driver are very cheap!

 * availability: all the part should be easy to get. In Germany you can order
   all the components at http://www.reichelt.de/

 * no need for a PCB: the whole designed could be wired on a prototype board.

 * flexibility: all pins are accessible. Even if ezRobi don't care about them
   ;-)


AVAILABLE FEATURES
------------------

The following list gives you an overview of the available features.

 * The `M32-Rob' can be programmed with the STK500 JTAG interface or with a
   cheap serial ISP programmer like the one used by famous PonyProg.

 * The motor driver BA6845FS is capable to drive two motors with 1A
   (each). See the datasheet fro details.

 * There are three LEDs and three keys for simply user-IO.
 
 * The UART is available as TTL. To connect to an PC, you have to use a level
   shifter (RS-232). One possible solution is the usage of adapter cables of
   older handys.

 * There are eight ADC inputs available (Port-A). The design uses Vcc as
   Vref.
 
 * Two external interrupt sources can be connected to connector ST9 and ST17.

 * The I2C bus is available on connector ST4.
