                           The Platform 'M32-Rob'

                 A hardware platform for the ezRobi project
                              $Revision: 1.5 $

An Overview

   The `M32-Rob' platform is a design of [1]Wiedekind-Klein. It is based
   on a cheap Atmel AVR Mega32. This platform is designed with the
   following topics in mind:
     * low price: the Mega32 and the motor driver are very cheap!
     * availability: all the parts should be easy to get. In Germany you
       can order all the components at [2]http://www.reichelt.de/
     * no need for a PCB: the whole designed could be wired on a
       prototype board.
     * flexibility: all pins are accessible. Even if ezRobi don't care
       about them ;-)

Available Features

   The following list gives you an overview of the available features.
     * The `M32-Rob' can be programmed with the STK500 JTAG interface or
       with a cheap serial ISP programmer like the one used by famous
       Pony-Prog.
     * The motor driver BA6845FS is capable to drive two motors with 1A
       (each). See the datasheet fro details.
     * There are three LEDs and three keys for simply user-IO.
     * The UART is available as TTL. To connect to an PC, you have to use
       a level shifter (RS-232). One possible solution is the usage of
       adapter cables of older handys.
     * There are eight ADC inputs available (Port-A). The design uses Vcc
       as Vref.
     * Two external interrupt sources can be connected to connector ST9
       and ST17.
     * The I2C bus is available on connector ST4.
