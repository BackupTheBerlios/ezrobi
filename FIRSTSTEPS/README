Welcome to `ezRobi', a GPL'd free embedded application framework to
ease robotics.

`ezRobi' is designed to help beginners to easily develop the firmware
for small autonomous robotics. The current release is based on the PCB
of Alexander Wiedekind-Klein. The used uController is a cheap Atmel
AVR Mega32.

One note about the term `framework'. I call this code a `framework'
for embedded applications (firmware) because it is used as a base for
your own work. `ezRobi' gives you all the base stuff around your
application, so you "only" have to add the logic. ;-)

In order to compile this application, you can use the free AVR-GCC
toolchain.

To flash the firmware into the controller, you can use avrdude with
one of these cheap ISP dongles.

Have fun.
