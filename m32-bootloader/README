Project:    Mega-32 Bootloader
Time-stamp: <2007-10-01 08:43:14 jd>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an adaption of the bootloader code from http:/reza.net/. I've changed
the code to match the AVR Mega-32 requirements.

This code is a first try and I don't know if it is the last one. ;-)

IMPORTANT: the project compiles, but it is not tested yet.


Have fun.
